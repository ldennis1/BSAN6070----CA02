# CA02 Spam Email Detection with Naive Bayes

In this exercise we shall train the model with set of emails labelled as either from Spam 
or Not Spam. There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam category. 
Next, we shall test the model on 260 emails. We shall ask model to predict the category 
of this emails and compare the accuracy with correct classification that we already know. 

## Steps to understand using Naive Bayes (Gaussian) 

1. Create your own personal Google Colab file and import necessary files
2. Clean and prepare the data (removing stop words, removing less frequent words) 
3. Create dictionary for the most common 3000 words
4. Create frequency and word label matrix 
5. Choose the model to use, in our case, use the Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes Classifier 
6. Analyze your accuracy score
